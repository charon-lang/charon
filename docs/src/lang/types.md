# Primitive

In Charon primitive types are builtin types whose values can be represented by a single integer value.

## Integer

|  Type   |        Bit Width         | Signedness | Note             |
| :-----: | :----------------------: | :--------: | ---------------- |
|  `u8`   |            8             |  unsigned  |                  |
|  `u16`  |            16            |  unsigned  |                  |
|  `u32`  |            32            |  unsigned  |                  |
|  `u64`  |            64            |  unsigned  |                  |
|  `i8`   |            8             |   signed   |                  |
|  `i16`  |            16            |   signed   |                  |
|  `i32`  |            32            |   signed   |                  |
|  `i64`  |            64            |   signed   |                  |
| `char`  |            8             |  unsigned  |                  |
| `paddr` | _platform address width_ |  unsigned  |                  |
| `vaddr` | _platform address width_ |  unsigned  |                  |
|  `ptr`  |                          |            | Alias of `vaddr` |
